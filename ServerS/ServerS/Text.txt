black and white
thick and furry
fast as the wind
always in a hurry
couple of spots
rub my ears
always comes when his name he hears
loves his ball; it's his favorite thing
what's most fun for him? Everything!
great big tongue that licks my face
has a crate, his very own space
big brown eyes like moon pies
he's my friend till the very end!
